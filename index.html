            <h3>Aspiring software engineer building and designing digital solutions.</h3>
            <p>As an Information Technology graduate with a 3.5 GPA, I'm consistently intrigued with studying and implementing the complexities of digital content.

            <p>
                Hello, my name is Corey and I'm mesmerized by technology. Ever since I was a wee lad, I've had lots of technological involvement. I was part of my mother's high school robotics team, excelled in CompTia+ college classes, and have been part of an honors Information Technology Academy with all A's. Fortunately enough, all of that was only in high school! I wanted to learn everything I possibly can to support others and decided to pursue a bachelor's in IT.
            </p>
            <p>
                At The University of North Carolina Pembroke, I've been fortunate to graduate with a 3.5 GPA, supported others through tutoring, and created useful applications and scripts. The main programming and scripting languages taught were Java and Linux-Bash. I later became a campus tutor for my college, helping students comprehend difficult concepts in their programming subjects and assignments for Spring 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I've spent my college years using Java, creating digital content is becoming another interest of mine. I'm currently creating a responsive website for an art friend while they are in college. My main focus now is to build innovative digital experiences while earning a Master's degree at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some of the technologies I'm currently working with:
